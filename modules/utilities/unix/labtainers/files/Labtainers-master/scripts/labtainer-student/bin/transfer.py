# Filename: transfer.py
# Description:
# This is the script to be run by the student to transfer file
# to/from the container from/to the host.
# Note:
# 1. It needs 'start.config' file, where
#    <labname> is given as a parameter to the script.
#
# It will perform the following tasks:
# a. If 'direction' is not specified, then 'direction' is default to 'TOHOST',
#    i.e., default direction is the transfer is from the container to the host.
# b. If 'direction' is 'TOCONTAINER', then transfer is from host to the container.
