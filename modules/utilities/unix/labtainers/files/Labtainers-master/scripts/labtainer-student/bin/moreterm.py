# Filename: moreterm.py
# Description:
# This is the script to be run by the student to spawn more terminals.
# Note:
# 1. It needs 'start.config' file, where
#    <labname> is given as a parameter to the script.
#
# It will perform the following tasks:
# a. If the lab has only one container, only one terminal for that
#    container will be spawned
# b. If the lab has multiple containers, the number of terminals
#    specified in the start.config will be used, unless
#    the user passed the optional argument specifying the number of
#    terminal
