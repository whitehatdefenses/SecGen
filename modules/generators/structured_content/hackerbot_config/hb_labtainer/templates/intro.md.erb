# Labtainers lab

## Getting started
### VMs in this lab

==Start these VMs== (if you haven't already):

- hackerbot_server (leave it running, you don't log into this)
- desktop

The desktop VM needs to be running to complete the lab, the hackbot_server VM needs to be running to obtain flags after completing the lab.

### Your login details for the "desktop" VM
User: <%= $main_user %>
Password: tiaspbiqe2r (**t**his **i**s **a** **s**ecure **p**assword **b**ut **i**s **q**uite **e**asy **2** **r**emember)

### For marks in the module
1. **You need to submit flags**. Note that the flags and the challenges in your VMs are different to other's in the class. Flags will be revealed to you as you complete challenges throughout the module. Flags look like this: ==flag{*somethingrandom*}==. Follow the link on the module page to submit your flags.
2. **You need to document the work and your solutions in a workbook**. This needs to include screenshots (including the flags) of how you solved each Hackerbot challenge and a writeup describing your solution to each challenge, and answering any written essay responses. The workbook will be submitted later in the semester.

Open the lab sheet linked from the terminal. (Often a PDF that you can right-click and Open).

You can skip the information about installing and controlling Labtainers and sending your results to your instructor -- it's all automated for you by Hacktivity and Hackerbot.

Work through the lab and when you have finished, tell Hackerbot you are "ready" and she will mark your work for you, providing flags for you to submit to Hacktivity for marks.

> Tip: Labtainers can be a bit picky about how you complete the tasks (including the specific commands used), so if it doesn't provide you with flags you beleive you have earned, then try completing the task again using full/different commands.

> Also note that sometimes you will be given multiple flags for having completed a task -- enter both in separately into Hacktivity.
